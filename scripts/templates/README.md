Template scripts for running slurm experiments for most of the experiments in the paper. Should be straight-forward to use, with the directory indicating the experiment type (e.g. - imagenet_ee_vit are the scripts for running ImageNet100 training with early-exit version of ViT), and the script names in the specific directories are continual learning method names.
These scripts should cover most of the experiments in the paper. Reach out to the authors in case of any questions.
