This code (in some capacity) was used to generate most of the plots in the paper. I do not have time to clean it up and frankly feel like it would not be worth the effort, but I include it here nonetheless as it might be of (some) use for the people trying to reproduce the results and replicate the paper.
The code is not well documented and I do not guarantee that it will run out of the box. It is also not optimized for speed or memory usage. It is just a quick and dirty way to generate the plots. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions about it but I also cannot guarantee that I remember how some of this stuff works as it was mostly scraped last-minute to produce the plots for the paper asap, without caring for the code quality.
